      <p>As a small business owner, sole proprietor or solopreneur, your livelihood depends on your ability to be functional at work.</p>
      <p>The medical service we receive in the UK is unparalleled in the event of an emergency or dire medical situation.</p>
      <p>That’s because the NHS provides treatment free of cost to those that are in imminent need.</p>
      <p class="italic"><i>… But that doesn’t mean our system is perfect.</i></p>
      <p class="bigger">It completely falls short when the medical service needed is NOT an emergency.</p>
      <p>If the problem isn’t critical then there is usually a great deal of lag time and deferred treatment put off for indeterminate periods of time.</p>
      <p class="bold"><strong>That means you’ll get treatment… whenever they can get to you.</strong></p>
      <p>Since your predicament is not considered life threatening, there really is nothing you can do but either hope to get better without treatment or wait out however long it might take you to get treated.</p>
      <p>That’s not very reassuring, is it?</p>
      <p>Especially in your field.</p>
      <p class="bigger next">You can’t afford to wait around, sick, before getting the treatment you deserve.</p>
      <p>You have customers and clients relying on you and your services to get them the results they’ve either already paid you for or are about to pay you for.</p>
      <p>You can’t just sit at home, recovering in bed, suffering or in pain, until someone gets around to seeing you, right?</p>

        <h2>That’s Why Private Medical Insurance <br> Was Created</h2>
      </header>
      <div class="wow fadeInRight"  data-wow-duration=".5s" data-wow-delay="0.1s">
        
        <p>Starting at as little as £30 pounds per month (plans may vary), you can get a private medical treatment plan that will ensure you get to see a specialist who can diagnose and help you get better sooner rather than later.</p>
        <p class="bigger">You can shortcut the entire waiting process and just get to seeing the expert that can help you, immediately.</p>
        <p>As a self employed professional, you know it is vital to get back to work at full earning capacity, otherwise clients may look elsewhere for your services, and some bills might have to go unpaid...</p>
        <p class="bold"><strong>Can you afford that?</strong></p>
        <p class="bold"><strong>Wouldn’t you rather get back on your feet sooner?</strong></p>
        <p class="bold"><strong>Don’t you want to get better faster?</strong></p>
        <p class="bigger">Now, you can empower yourself to cut the waiting list and get the treatment you need when you need it.</p>
        <p>Let others wait if they can afford to.</p>
        <p>You no longer have to.</p>
        <p class="bold"><strong>You have options.</strong></p>
